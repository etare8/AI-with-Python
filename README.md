# Artificial Intelligence using Python

This folder containes some codes that I used to learn some basic principles about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I have followed a YouTube Course from Harvard University that explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence ([Harvard CS50's AI with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NgNicANyqM&t=38762s)). This course is developed by [Brian Yu](https://brianyu.me/) and [David Malan](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/) for the Harvard University and explores the following topics:

## Topics:
* Search Algorithms
* Knowledge
* Uncertainty
* Optimization
* Learning Algorithms
* Neural Networks
* Language Manipulation

I have taken codes that have been developed during this course and that are available for free at the link reported above, and I have used them to comprehend better how to use Python for these aims. I focused especially on Search Algorithms, Learning Algorithms and Neural Networks.
